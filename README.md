**Map**

You can customise tags by editing `Map` field in Column Settings, using string or regex to replace tags to your desired format.
You can refer to [this link](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) or any other tutorials for regex syntax.

Most of tags comprises of two parts: field name and value, separated by a space. Some tags are field only.
**NB**: you will need to alter field name and value respectively:

Here are some examples:

SCI:

```ini
SCI=, 
/SCIIF/=IF, 
```

EI:

```ini
EIæ£ç´¢=EI, 
```

Decrease decimal:

```ini
/^(\d+)\.(\d{1})\d*$/=$1.$2, 
```

Chinese PKU Chinese Core:

```ini
åå¤§ä¸­ææ ¸å¿=PKU Core, 
```

Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) warnings:

```ini
SCIWARN=ð«, 
```

CAS quartiles SCI Upgraded Edition:

## Nested Tags

> Nested tags can recategorize your Zotero items. It could replace Zotero's collection to some extent.

<details> 

You can switch between the nested tags view provided by the plugin and the tags view provided by Zotero itself with ease. 

<summary>Demonstration</summary>

For a tag to show up with the plugin it must start with a # and the subcategory must start with a forward slash (/) in the format of:

For example:

"#Catergory/subcategory"
"#Method/Longitudinal"
"#Method/cross-sectional"

The plugin also allows tags to show up in Zotero item pane.

Note: You can configure the plugin so the tag doesn't have to start with #. To do this you need to edit the "#Tag" column in the item pane and remove or change the #.
